# GMTKJam2018  
This is a 48 hour game making marathon, focused on design, mechanics, and clever ideas. The jam runs from August 31st, at 10PM UK time, to September 2nd, at 10PM UK time.  
Theme is: GENRE, but you canâ€™t MECHANIC.  
I was thinking of using puzzlescript, so maybe a puzzle where you can't move the blocks?
